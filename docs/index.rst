Welcome to dttr's documentation!
================================

dttr is a command line tool to manage your dotfiles using a template system to allow making modifications in multiple files all at once while keeping things consistent and easy to mantain.

By writing your dotfiles using a template language (i.e. keeping the same exact files except when you want to make some value variable) and the data (that will inserted in the template) in configuration files, dttr can produce different sets of usable dotfiles with minimal effort.
